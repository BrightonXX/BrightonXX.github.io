## About Me

Hi! I'm **Brighton** (Yi Xu), a junior CS student at SUSTech (Southern University of Science and Technology).

I'm passionate about technology and the world we live in. This blog is where I share my journey in computer science, projects I'm working on, and things I'm learning.

My interests include:
- Software development
- Open source projects
- Learning new technologies
- Solving interesting problems

## Philosophy

**"Move Fast and Break Things"**

I believe in rapid experimentation and learning by doing. Sometimes things break, and that's okay - that's how we learn and grow.
