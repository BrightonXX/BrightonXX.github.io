# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Brighton (Yi Xu), a junior CS student at SUSTech.

This is my first post, marking the beginning of my blogging journey. I plan to share my thoughts on:

- Projects or Researches I'm working on
- Things I'm learning or interested in
- Any random musings

## Why Move Fast and Break Things?

Starting doing something is more worthy than doing something perfectly, especially when you are young and energetic. 

Actually, the moment I read this sentence, it immediately resonated with me. I’m not sure whether this comes from studying computer science—a field that iterates at an extremely high speed—or from my own personality, but I believe that many things today, whether learning or research, need to be approached in a wilder, more aggressive way. On the one hand, moving too slowly really does mean getting outpaced by iteration itself; on the other hand, this is genuinely the fastest way to experiment, make mistakes, and improve. Even if things break along the way, that’s perfectly fine.

## Notice

I tried to but somehow failed to use English throughout all my abstract thinkings, so When I comes to personal thoughts, I may switch between English and Chinese in this blog. 

Stay tuned for more posts!
