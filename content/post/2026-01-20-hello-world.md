# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Yi Xu, a junior CS student at SUSTech.

This is my first post, marking the beginning of my blogging journey. I plan to share my thoughts on:

- Programming and software development
- Projects I'm working on
- Things I'm learning
- Life in general

## Why "Move Fast and Break Things"?

I believe in rapid experimentation and learning by doing. Sometimes things break, and that's okay - that's how we learn and grow.

Stay tuned for more posts!
